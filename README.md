Makeblock-Help-App-For-Scratch-Offline
======================================
Scratch 2.0 can be extended to control external devices (e.g. robotics kits, musical instruments) and to access data from external sensor hardware (e.g. sensor boards). A Scratch 2.0 extension extends Scratch with a collection of command and reporter blocks that can be used to interact with a particular device. When an extension is enabled, its blocks appear in the "More Blocks" palette.

Installation

In order to connect Scratch 2.0 with Makeblock, you will need to install a helper application, the "Makeblock For Scratch". Follow the instructions for your OS:

Windows

Download the Windows installer and double click on it. Follow the instructions in the installer. Once installation is complete, M4Scratch will appear on Start Menu.

Mac

Drag the "M4Scratch" icon into the "Applications" directory. To run it, go to Applications and double click on M4Scratch.


Running Scratch with Makeblock

At present, the Makeblock only works with the Scratch 2.0 offline editor. Once you have installed the editor and the M4Scratch, do the following:

1.Plug in a Makeblock.
Start the Makeblock helper application. It should show that the Makeblock is connected.
2.Start Scratch 2.0.
3.Import the Makeblock Extension file (makeblock.s2e). Hold down the Shift key and click on File at the top left hand corner of the page. 
4. Now click on More Blocks to see the Makeblock's blocks!
5.Upload the ScratchSerial.ino to your baseboard or meduino.
